Batched evaluation with tiling
##############################

All calculators evaluate one system per :meth:`forward <torchpme.Calculator.forward>`
call. For training on datasets of many small, differently sized systems this is
inefficient: each call launches the same sequence of small kernels, and the natural
alternative — padding every system to a common size and using ``torch.vmap`` — wastes
compute and memory on padding, since every system is padded to the largest atom count
*and* the largest k-vector count in the batch.

The *tiled* batched evaluation, available for :class:`torchpme.EwaldCalculator`
through :meth:`forward_batched <torchpme.EwaldCalculator.forward_batched>`, avoids
both problems. It rests on two ideas, described below: a single parameter
:math:`\mathrm{num\_k}` that balances real- and reciprocal-space work for every system
at once, and a block-diagonal tiled evaluation of the reciprocal-space sum that never
materializes a padded rectangle.

The knob: ``num_k``
===================

The Ewald method splits the interaction into a short-range part, summed over a
neighbor list truncated at a cutoff :math:`r_c`, and a long-range part, summed over
reciprocal-space vectors. Both are controlled by the smearing :math:`\sigma`: a
smaller :math:`\sigma` shifts work from real space (smaller :math:`r_c`) to
reciprocal space (more k-vectors), and vice versa.

In the batched evaluation you do not pick :math:`\sigma` or :math:`r_c` per system.
Instead you pick one **target half-space k-vector count** :math:`\mathrm{num\_k}`,
shared by every system. Inverting the k-count of a cell with basis-vector lengths
:math:`L_1, L_2, L_3` gives a per-system reciprocal resolution, from which the
smearing and the real-space cutoff follow:

.. math::

    \lambda_b = \left(\frac{L_1 L_2 L_3}{2\,\mathrm{num\_k}}\right)^{1/3},
    \qquad
    \sigma_b = 2\lambda_b,
    \qquad
    r_c(b) = 4\sigma_b = 8\lambda_b

Every system thus realizes *roughly* :math:`\mathrm{num\_k}` k-vectors — the k-axis
of the batch has an (almost) fixed size, independent of how large the largest cell is
— while its real-space cutoff grows with the cell so that the overall accuracy stays
balanced. Increasing :math:`\mathrm{num\_k}` uniformly moves work from the neighbor
list to the reciprocal sum.

:func:`torchpme.lib.ewald_params_from_num_k` computes
:math:`(\lambda_b, \sigma_b, r_c(b))` from a cell (or a batch of cells). The
**neighbor list of each system must be built at its own** :math:`r_c(b)` (or any
larger radius) *before* collating the batch; since :math:`r_c(b)` only depends on the
cell and :math:`\mathrm{num\_k}`, this can be done once per dataset.

Block-diagonal tiled summation
==============================

The reciprocal-space part of the Ewald sum is, per system, an outer product between
atoms and k-vectors. Across a batch this work matrix is **block-diagonal**: atoms of
one system never interact with k-vectors of another. The tiled evaluation exploits
this directly:

- **Atoms** are laid out in one flat, concatenated array; each system's atom count is
  rounded up to a multiple of the atom-tile size ``block_atoms`` ("sum-padding" — the
  total padding is at most ``block_atoms`` per system, unlike rectangular padding to
  the largest system).
- **K-vectors** form a rectangular array of shape ``[n_systems, K_pad, 3]``, where
  ``K_pad`` is the common padded k-count (a multiple of the k-tile size
  ``block_kvecs``). Padded rows are zero vectors.
- A host-built **dispatch table** enumerates only the on-diagonal
  ``(system, atom_tile, k_tile)`` work blocks. The kernel runs two passes over these
  tiles: pass one accumulates each system's structure factors, pass two contracts
  them back into per-atom potentials. The dense
  ``[n_systems, max_atoms, max_kvectors]`` array of a padded batch is never formed.

Padding is inert by construction: padded atoms carry zero charge, and padded k-rows
are zero vectors, which the potentials map to a zero reciprocal-space kernel.

.. note::

    The tiled evaluation removes the *heterogeneity* waste (padding to the largest
    system). Its peak memory is still the block-diagonal product
    :math:`O(N_\mathrm{tot}\,K_\mathrm{pad})` — the phase matrix of all on-diagonal
    tiles — in both the forward and the backward pass.

Shape stability
---------------

Because the per-axis k-grid extents are rounded up, each system realizes slightly
more than :math:`\mathrm{num\_k}` k-vectors. The k-axis is therefore padded to a
window of ``(1 + k_pad_fraction) * num_k`` (default 10 %), so that every batch
prepared with the same ``num_k`` gets the *same* ``K_pad`` — useful under
``torch.compile``, where stable shapes avoid recompilation. If a cell overshoots the
window, the batch is still valid (``K_pad`` grows), and a warning suggests increasing
``k_pad_fraction``.

Mixed periodicities
===================

A single tiled batch may mix:

- **3D-periodic** systems — the standard Ewald evaluation.
- **2D-periodic slabs** — the vacuum axis is internally replaced by an *effective*
  shrunk axis of length ``thickness + 1.5 * L_max`` (see
  :func:`torchpme.lib.shrink_2d_cell`; a zero vacuum row, as used by ``metatomic``
  for non-periodic directions, is supported), which keeps the derived parameters and
  k-grid physical, and a slab (Yeh–Berkowitz) correction is applied. The slab
  correction is implemented for :class:`torchpme.CoulombPotential` (and the
  equivalent :class:`torchpme.InversePowerLawPotential` with ``exponent=1``); for
  other potentials the atoms of 2D systems evaluate to ``NaN`` — loudly, rather than
  silently wrong.
- **Non-periodic clusters** — no reciprocal-space part at all; their pair list is
  summed with the *bare* (non-range-separated) potential.

1D-periodic systems are not supported and are rejected at collation time.

Usage: pure torch
=================

The evaluation is split into a host-side preparation step, run once per batch, and
the differentiable ``forward_batched`` call:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    import vesin

    import torchpme
    from torchpme.lib import ewald_params_from_num_k, prepare_tiled_batch

    num_k = 200

    # 1. per-system neighbor lists at the num_k-derived cutoff
    for system in systems:
        _, _, cutoff = ewald_params_from_num_k(
            system["cell"], system["periodic"], num_k
        )
        nl = vesin.NeighborList(cutoff=float(cutoff), full_list=False)
        system["neighbor_indices"], system["neighbor_distances"] = ...

    # 2. collate (host-side, once per batch)
    batch, tiling = prepare_tiled_batch(
        positions=[s["positions"] for s in systems],
        charges=[s["charges"] for s in systems],
        cells=[s["cell"] for s in systems],
        periodic=[s["periodic"] for s in systems],
        neighbor_indices=[s["neighbor_indices"] for s in systems],
        neighbor_distances=[s["neighbor_distances"] for s in systems],
        num_k=num_k,
    )

    # 3. evaluate; the tiling's per-system smearing overrides the potential's
    calculator = torchpme.EwaldCalculator(
        torchpme.CoulombPotential(smearing=1.0), lr_wavelength=1.0
    )
    potentials = calculator.forward_batched(
        batch["charges"],
        batch["cell"],
        batch["positions"],
        batch["neighbor_indices"],
        batch["neighbor_distances"],
        batch["system_index"],
        batch["periodic"],
        tiling,
    )

The result is the concatenation of the per-atom potentials; split it per system with
``batch["system_index"]``. For **forces**, recompute the pair distances inside the
computational graph (from positions, neighbor indices and cell shifts) and pass those
instead of ``batch["neighbor_distances"]`` — a precomputed distance array is a
constant to autograd. For a runnable end-to-end version, see the
:ref:`batched example <sphx_glr_examples_13-batched-ewald.py>`.

Usage: metatensor interface
===========================

The :ref:`metatensor bindings <metatensor>` mirror the same split.
:func:`torchpme.metatensor.prepare_tiled_batch` builds the tiling directly from
:class:`metatomic.torch.System` objects (with attached ``"charge"`` data) and their
neighbor-list :class:`TensorBlock <metatensor.torch.TensorBlock>` objects, and
:meth:`forward_batched <torchpme.metatensor.Calculator.forward_batched>` evaluates
the batch, returning a :class:`metatensor.torch.TensorMap` whose samples label each
atom by ``("system", "atom")``:

.. code-block:: python

    import torchpme

    tiling = torchpme.metatensor.prepare_tiled_batch(systems, neighbors, num_k=200)

    calculator = torchpme.metatensor.EwaldCalculator(
        torchpme.CoulombPotential(smearing=1.0), lr_wavelength=1.0
    )
    result = calculator.forward_batched(systems, neighbors, tiling)
    potentials = result.block().values

Pair distances are recomputed internally from the neighbor blocks' distance
*vectors*, so forces flow to the positions those vectors were computed from. The
calculator (including ``forward_batched``) is TorchScript-compatible; only the
``prepare_tiled_batch`` helpers are eager-only host code.

Practical notes
===============

- Only :class:`torchpme.EwaldCalculator` implements the tiled evaluation; the
  mesh-based calculators (:class:`torchpme.PMECalculator`,
  :class:`torchpme.P3MCalculator`) raise :class:`NotImplementedError`.
- ``float64`` is recommended, as for all Ewald evaluations.
- On CUDA, the scatter reductions (``index_add_``) used by the kernel are
  non-deterministic by default; call ``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)``
  for bit-reproducible results and gradients.
- The physical result is independent of the tile sizes ``block_atoms`` /
  ``block_kvecs`` (up to floating-point summation order); they only affect
  performance.
- The tiling depends only on cells, periodicities, atom counts and pair counts — it
  must be rebuilt when those change (e.g. a new batch), not when positions move.
